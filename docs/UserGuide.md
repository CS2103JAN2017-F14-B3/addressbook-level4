1. Download the latest `Dowat.jar` from the 'releases' tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task book.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. Refer to [UI Control](#ui-control) for a more detailed walkthrough of various UI components.

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`add try out Dowat /by tomorrow`**: will add a task into the application. The task will be shown in the list and calendar as highlighted.   
   <img src="images/Add.png" width="500">
   * **`mark 1`**: after you are done with a task, simply mark it off from the list. Tasks will be sorted so you can easily find those tasks with closer deadlines at the top of the list!
   * **`list /t /a`** : you can also lists all tasks that are completed, and shown as below.  
   <img src="images/List_Done.png" width="500">
   * **`undo`**: if you accidently do anything wrong, you can undo the modifications also!
   * **`edit /t 1 /by one hour later`** Edit any field you need (description, name, deadline, event duration ...) with the edit command. Where the index `1` refers to the index of the task / event in the respective list.   
   :wink: Check out the [Features](#features) for a complete set of commands you can use!

#### Traversing between Windows
The four main windows in which you can traverse are:

  * Command Box
  * Result Display Panel
  * Task Panel
  * Event Panel

By utilizing the TAB key, you are able to switch between the different windows in the above-mentioned order. 
The order of traversal is descending down the list before it loops back to the beginning. 

The window in which you are currently on is shown by a brown border highlight. 
An example of window traversal is shown in the figure below.

<img src="images/WindowTraversal.gif" width="700">

#### Command Box Features
When the Command Box is selected, it has 2 main features:

* Clearing the Command Box

  Pressing the DELETE key will clear the Command Box of its text content. This allows for easy clearing of commands.
  	<img src="images/CommandBoxDelete.gif" width="700">

* Accessing past History of Commands
  
  Pressing the UP key will access the previous command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 
  Pressing the DOWN key will access the next command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 

  The Command history resets itself after each session of usage (i.e exit the program).
  A Command is only added into the Command history when it is executed by the Command Box (i.e ENTER key press).
  <img src="images/CommandBoxHistory.gif" width="700">

#### Result Display Panel Features
When the Result Display Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. 
This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.
